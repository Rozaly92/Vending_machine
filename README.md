#VENDING MACHINE

_This is a console application._
Java takes a Json file (which contains a list of products), reads it
and prints the data to the console.

_The user selects the desired product by entering the id specified for each product._

_The user then has to enter the quantity of the selected product._

_After entering the quantity, the user enters the money._

_The program calculates and if there is enough money, it returns the change, otherwise it returns the money._

In the case when the user has bought a product, the data is updated in the Json file with a reduced amount of the product.

- press run
- enter selected product
- enter amount
- enter money
